// example for opening a door for a specific time

// open door and set close-time to now (1) plus 10 cycles
// the block line costs an additional cycle, therefore we need to substract 1
// also take not of the start time so we can check the result later
// as all statements are on the same line (separated by ;) they are executed at the same time
:door="open"; closewhen=time()+(10-1); start=time()
// block while closewhen is not reached
wait time()<closewhen
// close the door
:door="closed"; :out="door closed after "+(time()-start)+" cycles"
